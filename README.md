This is a sample API provides access to a mocked movies database.

There are 2 API operations available for 2 popular movie databases, cinemaworld and filmworld

/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movies : This returns the movies that are available
/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movie/{ID}: This returns the details of a single movie
To access this API you'll require an API token.

Also just like any realworld API these may be flakey at times :)
Exercise
Build a web app to allow customers to get the cheapest price for movies from these two providers in a timely manner.

Design a solution to have a functioning app when not all of the providers are functioning at 100 %.
